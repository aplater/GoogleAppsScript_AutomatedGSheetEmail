# Google Sheet Apps Script for Notification/Reminder Emails

## Objective
This script works with Google Sheet and Script Editor and aims to automate notification/reminder emails based on a date comparison. The script also utilises triggers to be automatically executed.  

## Example
As an example, an owner of a monthly team event would receive a Gmail notification, if it's his/her turn to organize a monthly event. Additionally, a second reminder is placed one week after the first email.
